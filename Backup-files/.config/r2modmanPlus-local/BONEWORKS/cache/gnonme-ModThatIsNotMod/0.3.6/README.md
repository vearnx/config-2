# ModThatIsNotMod
This is a BONEWORKS mod for loading in custom items, making life easier for other mod creators, and a whole lot more.

If you want to support me: <b>https://ko-fi.com/gnonme</b>

Feel free to make a PR for new features and bug fixes, just make sure the code is commented/easily understandable, and doesn't noticeably affect performance.

## Features
- Load custom items into the game
- A custom menu that other mods can use
- Eject mags with the press of a button
- Easily get references to the player, hands, and controllers
- Get the currently held objects
- Events for when guns fire, objects are grabbed, the player dies, etc
- Replace dummy shaders with the real ingame versions
- Spawn items from pools
- Check if mods are up to date
- Send notifications to the player
- Access methods with Nullable<T> arguments that are normally broken
- Much more

### Custom Items
Place `.melon` files into `UserData/CustomItems` and they will be loaded automatically. If you don't have those folders, either manually create them or run the game once with this mod installed.

### BoneMenu
This is a custom menu that can be used by other mods. It has some basic default functionality for giving yourself ammo and spawning random custom items.
You can open and close BoneMenu either through the radial menu or a hand gesture. Using the radial menu is the default option for new installs, but I personally find the gesture nicer to use once you're used to it.

### Disabling Stats
The info collected is very basic and fully anonymous (you can check `Stats.cs`), but if you still want to disable it, just add `DisableStats = true` to the preferences file under the `[ModThatIsNotMod]` heading or do it through bonemenu.

## User Preferences
You will have to run the game once with the mod installed before the preferences will show up.

Preferences are stored in `UserData/ModThatIsNotMod.cfg`.

#### Mag eject prefs
- MagEjectButtonEnabled: Whether or not the menu button should be used to eject mags from guns.
- PressesToEjectMag: How many times you have to press the menu button to eject a mag, if that feature is enabled.
- AutoEjectEmptyMags: Should mags be automatically ejected once they're empty.
- OverrideMagEjectSettings: Custom guns can force disable the mag eject button or force enable/disable auto ejecting. This will ignore that and always use your preferences.

#### BoneMenu prefs
- BoneMenuGestureEnabled: Enable to open BoneMenu by pointing your both palms up and slightly forward, and close it by pointing whichever hand it's attached to, by default your left, down and slightly forwards.
- BoneMenuRadialButtonEnabled: Lets you open BoneMenu from the radial menu.
- MenuOnRightHand: Enable this if you want the menu to follow your right hand instead of your left.
- MenuOffsetX, MenuOffsetY, and MenuOffsetZ: Allows you to change the position of the menu relative to your hand.

#### Notification prefs
- NotificationsOnRightHand: Enable this if you want notifications to follow your right hand instead of your left.
- NotificationOffsetX, NotificationOffsetY, and NotificationOffsetZ: Changes the position of the notifications relative to your hand.

#### Misc prefs
- AutomaticSpawnGuns: Will make the utility gun fully automatic.
- UtilGunInRadialMenu: Always have an option to spawn the utility gun from the radial menu, even in levels that usually don't allow it.
- InfiniteAmmoGuns: You can put custom gun names in this list to add a variant of them with infinite ammo to the spawn menu.

#### Meme prefs
- TabloidMode: Adds fun stuff to the screen outside of VR.
- HappyFunTime: Spawns fake ads or pictures of dogs occasionally.
- HappyFunTimeDelay: The min/max time between spawning a new ad or dog pic.

#### Debug prefs
- LoggingMode: Controls how much info from this mod is displayed in the console. The four options are "MINIMAL", "NORMAL", "VERBOSE", and "DEBUG".
- AllowEmbeddedCode: Some custom items have a dll embedded in them for extra functionality and this will let that code be run.
- ExportEmbeddedAssemblies: This will save any embedded dlls into `UserData/ExportedAssemblies`
- SilenceUnhollowerWarnings: Hide warnings about unsupported return types and parameters from the assembly unhollower
- ReloadItemsOnLevelChange: Reload any modified .melon files when you load into a new level, useful for quickly testing changes to your items without having to close the game.
