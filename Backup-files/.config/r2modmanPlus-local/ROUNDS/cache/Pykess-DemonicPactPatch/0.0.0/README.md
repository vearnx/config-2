# DemonicPactPatch
------------------

This is a utility mod which fixes a bug in the base game which caused Demonic Pact to break certain cards after a rematch.

Previously, if a player took Demonic Pact in a game, then finished that game and rematched, automatic fire would be disabled for them in all subsequent games. This broke cards like Spray for that player until they quit to main menu.
