# TemporaryStatsPatch
------------------

This is a utility mod which patches several methods in the base game regarding temporary stat effects. These methods in the base game did not revert stats in a way that allowed for multiple effects to be applied safely at once, causing issues with several modded cards. The patches in this mod fix this issue.
