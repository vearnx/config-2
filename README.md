# Home-folder-backups & Script

This contains my .conifg backups and it also contains my Script that i use to do it Also (For now) Includes my ULTRAKILL Cracked save, so yea have fun with that (Prob gonna buy the gane on steam soon)

For the script to work, you need rsync and Figlet (Optional, just if you wanna see "BACKUP SCRIPT" In fancy, big letters)

Do with this as you want, For the script change your paths to adjust for your setup.
